BAR assistant using Tabrisjs


### Branding

I've built Cordova hybrid apps, so this should have been obvious, BUT, to get branding to work with the Tabris build service, the files must be located under the cordova/ folder in a tabris-style project layout.

The paths to the files referenced in the cordova/config.xml file are relative to the cordova/ folder.
